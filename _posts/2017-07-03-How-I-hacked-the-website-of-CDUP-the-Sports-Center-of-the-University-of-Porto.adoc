# How I hacked the website of CDUP, the Sports Center of the University of Porto

While checking the gym prices at CDUP, my friend http://diogomoura.me[Diogo Moura] noticed something unusual: a small square on the bottom-left corner that when clicked would display a bar sticking to the bottom of the screen.
I didn't capture a screenshot so I recreated the page in Photoshop:

Diogo is a good guy so he stopped there.

I started investigating that bar and noticed it was the http://phpdebugbar.com/[PHP Debug Bar], useful for debugging purposes during development. It contains some tabs with multiple information about everything that happens in the website. One of the features it provides is a list of the latest HTTP requests made by every user on the website:

.Request list

Obviously, this is a big security issue, since I could trace the actions in the website of whoever I wanted. Some of the entries in that list had the text "/login" in the URL field and "POST" in the method field, meaning that they were related to submissions of the administrator login form. By clicking that entry I was able to see all details of that specific request, including the username and the plaintext password that were sent in the body of the request:

....
{  
   "_token":"YVOzlSSYcaEEkPF24AVNke2KsdvEUZedIwNtHyJo",
   "username":"Admin",
   "password":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
}
....

So I went to the http://cdup.up.pt/admin[administrator login form] and successfully logged in with the credentials I had just stolen. Now I had access to the backoffice of the whole website and I could manage users, edit content, etc.

The issue was reported to CDUP and was fixed quickly by removing the PHP Debug Bar.
