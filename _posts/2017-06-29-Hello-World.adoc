# Hello World!

This is the first post of my new personal blog, where I will briefly present myself and the purpose of this blog.

I am a Portuguese student currently enrolled in the Master in Informatics and Computer Engineering at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. You can find more information about me and what I do here: http://gustavosilva.me[gustavosilva.me]

At the moment, I have some ideas ready to be published related to my recent _hacktivities_. After that, I will either let it die or write about whatever crosses my mind.
